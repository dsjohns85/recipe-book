## Instructions

1. **Cook Rice (Instant Pot)**  
   Rinse rice thoroughly. Add to Instant Pot with 2¼ cups water and salt.  
   Pressure cook on High for 4 minutes, then natural release for 10 minutes.  
   Fluff with fork and stir in butter (optional).

2. **Prepare Chicken Marinade**  
   In a large bowl, combine olive oil, lemon juice, and all spices.  
   Add chicken thighs and coat thoroughly. Let marinate 15–30 minutes (or skip if in a hurry).

3. **Grill Chicken**  
   Preheat grill to medium-high heat.  
   Grill thighs ~6–7 minutes per side, or until internal temp reaches 165°F.  
   Let rest 5 minutes, then slice.

4. **Make Yogurt Sauce**  
   In a small bowl, combine Greek yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, and salt.

5. **Optional Salad**  
   Toss tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion with lemon juice and salt.  
   Let sit for 10–15 minutes to marinate.

6. **Assemble Bowls**  
   Adults: Layer sliced chicken over salad or rice, drizzle with yogurt sauce, add optional hummus.  
   Kids: Serve sliced chicken with rice and yogurt as a dip.

## Notes

- Hummus adds flavor and fiber but bumps up fat slightly.
- Chicken can be prepped ahead and reheated.
- Use leftovers in wraps or with eggs the next day!
